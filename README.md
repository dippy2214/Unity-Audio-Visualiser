# Unity Audio Visualiser üé∂
This project initially began as a side project being developed for my sister, who has always enjoyed music with visualiser effects.
working towards the deadline of her birthday, which gave me roughly a month for this project, I had a great time figuring out how to
make use of fast forier transforms and import files in unity for the creation of this program.

The key goals I was working towards with this project were to make it look good (not necessarily complex, just simple and clean), to
make it capable of loading external files in some way, and to make it within the one month deadline. I am pleased to say that all of 
these have been achieved, and I was even able to add some simple visual customisation options before shipping.

## How to Use üßë‚Äçüè´
The audio visualiser upon being ran will look for a folder in your documents titled "AudioVisualiserMusic". It will look for the audio
you have placed in this folder with the .mp3 file extension, and if the file doesn't exist it will create it. simply put your music 
into this folder and enjoy listening!

## The Development Process üõ†Ô∏è 

### ü§î Defining the Goals
My first step with this project was actually talking to my sister a bit about what she would be interested in. Having these chats and
defining exactly what was required to make the product that she would enjoy was my first time making a project for somebody other than 
myself outside of uni, which was an interesting experience despite obviously being quite unofficial. These experiences were built upon
further through things like my third year professional project, where we worked with industry clients, and I found the lessons learned 
here to come in handy with that project too, espoecially the importance of defining proper goals and end points for the project. 

The first point key point that was brought up was that she wanted to be able to use this with her own music and load in her own songs.
Initially I wanted to do more than just this, as I was hoping to give the program settings to visualise all system audio so that music
didn't necessarily need to be played through the visualiser program, and make it easier than it ended up being to load in files, but this
proved to be a lesson for me in managing scope. I had given myself a month for a project I wasn't working on full time to figure out how
to make systems I had no experience with, and these features had to be cut in the interests of finishing the project for her birthday.

The other point to note was that we wanted it to look nice, since that was the whole point of having the audio visualised in the first place.
